Welcome to Osama and Turki Libraries Management System, Our system consists of two types of users (Treasurer and Manager), each with their own powers. For example, (the cashier) can search for any book by book number, book title, or book author name. He can also sell books and print the invoice. As for the manager, he can add a new book, delete a book from the library, or modify an existing book. It can also search for any book using the number, title, or author name of the book, and when choosing the position or authority, the user must then specify the number of operations that the user wants to perform.
