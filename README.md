Welcome to Osama and Turki Library Management System, Our system consists of two types of users (Treasurer and Manager), each with their own powers. For example, the (treasurer) can search for any book by the book number, title of the book, or the name of the author of the book. He can also sell books and print the invoice. As for the (manager) he can add a new book, delete a book from the library, or modify an existing book. He can also search for any book using the number, title, or name of the author of the book, and this program was built using the Dart language on the editor / Visual Studio Code, and a drawing (Flowchart), a drawing (Use Case) and a drawing (Class Diagram) are attached to it. How to build the program, and in light of this, the system was completed by reviewing the previously prepared drawing; You can also know the system using the drawing and compare it with the attached code.
